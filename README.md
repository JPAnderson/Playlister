This application takes an artist specified by the user, and a number of songs, and generates a random 
playlist of a style based on the artist named, much like pandora. It uses and API called echo nest to
create this random playlist. The playlist created can then be saved to a database as a table, and when needed
can be retrieved again by searching for it by name.
